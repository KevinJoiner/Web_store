Overall experince:

Overall this project was on of the most challenging of my carrer at UK but also very rewarding
There was a bit of a learning curve when learning how to use php with mysql server
such as making querys using the php and protecting against SQL injection.
Many hours where put into this project and a couple all-nighters, but it is worth is now
to be able to use the knowledge I have learned in class in a practicle way and be able
to apply in in future projects.
