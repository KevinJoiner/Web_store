Testing: 
All of the features were tested for basic functionality then some were tested for specific bugs.

		Log in: First when testing the login function I used invalid info to make sure that they will nnot be alowed
					SQL injection input was tested to make sure that only valid credentials work
			
		Product: When testing the product search querrys I test all of the possible combinations of seraches such as min and text or max and nothing else
					The price search compares the original price and not the promotion price.
		
		Updating inventory: I tested the attempt to use negative number in the inventory. or a promo percentage out of the rang 0- 99
								Tested leaving an enrtry blank which gives and error in the query.
